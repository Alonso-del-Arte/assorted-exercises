# Assorted Exercises

These exercises are for a Java cohort I'm in as a student.

### System specifications

* Java 11, but Java 8 might be sufficient for the early exercises. 
* JUnit 5, at first more because of the imports than because of any specific 
JUnit 5 features.
* IntelliJ IDEA for ease of bringing the project into your local machine. Can 
use Apache NetBeans or Eclipse with just a little effort.

### Notes for Hacktoberfest participants

This repository is closed to Hacktoberfest. I have other repositories that I 
intend to open to Hacktoberfest shortly before October 1, 2022. Those other 
repositories have a CONTRIBUTING.md file at their respective root levels, this 
repository doesn't.

## Project 1: Dragon Cave

The classic text game in which you have to go into one of two caves. No 
consideration for exceptions or testing at this point.

## Project 2

A number guessing game.
